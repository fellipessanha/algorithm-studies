# Algorithms

Algoritm studies dump. Some leetcode, some tooling and some general tests. Always a work in progress.
I plant to bring some of my leetcode solutions here, too, someday.

## Go

Leetcoding in Go is really fun because I get to implement all the data structures that are taken
for granted in languages such as C++, Python, and Rust.

You'll find some Data structure implementations there, such as a [BinaryHeap](./go/heap/) and RBTree(WIP).

[tcp-to-http](./go/tcp-to-http/) is a really high level study on how gorotines, channels, TCP, UDP,
and HTTP work, based on a boot.dev course.
